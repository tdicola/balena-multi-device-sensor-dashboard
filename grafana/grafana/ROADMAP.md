# Roadmap (2018-08-07)

This roadmap is a tentative plan for the core development team. Things change constantly as PRs come in and priorities change. 
But it will give you an idea of our current vision and plan. 
  
### Short term (1-2 months)
  - PRs & Bugs
  - React Panel Support
  - React Query Editor Support
  - Metrics & Log Explore UI 
  - Grafana UI library shared between grafana & plugins
  - Seperate visualization from panels
  - More reuse between Explore & dashboard
  - Explore logging support for more data sources 
   
### Mid term (2-4 months)  
  - Drilldown links
  - Dashboards as code workflows 
  - React migration
  - New panels 
  
### Long term (4 - 8 months)
 - Alerting improvements (silence, per series tracking, etc)

### In a distant future far far away
 - Meta queries 
 - Integrated light weight TSDB
 - Web socket & live data sources

### Outside contributions
We know this is being worked on right now by contributors (and we hope to merge it when it's ready).
